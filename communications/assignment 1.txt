Hello everyone,

The assignment for the week of April 27 is to do the first two sections of the Udemy course, "Getting Started with Git" and "Getting Started with GitHub".  These two sets of videos will walk you through installing git, signing up for GitHub, and doing some initial first git tasks.

Notes on sections 1&2:
- You should be doing the same operations as the instructor as you watch.  So you should allow more time than just the time it takes to watch the video.
- If you know any git or GitHub, this week will go by fast.
- Note that your screen output might vary from the instructor's.  Usually the differences are small and not important.  This is especially true if you've used git before and have some things already configured.  I also noticed that my screen output was often more verbose than his.
- If you have problems, first take a look at the Q&A for the lecture (choose the Q&A tab below video, set filter to "current lecture").
    + For example, I had a problem in video 16 where my screen output didn't match his at all, and the solution appears in the Q&A.
- But you can always ask for help on the Slack channel.  The Slack channel is also a good place to request specific discussion or demonstrations you'd like to see in the live class.
    + I'll try to check Slack and email this weekend, since we're just getting set up.  In general, though, I tend to be fairly disconnected from Janelia during off-hours.
- There are sections on using git on Mac, Windows, and Linux; you can skip the sections for the operating systems that you don't use.

Possible/probable topics for the first SciComp meeting:
- short summary of Udemy sections 1&2, plus commentary
- why use git on the command-line?
- thoughts on GUI git clients
- general Q&A

The first week is intentionally light to allow time to figure out any technical issues with git, GitHub, Slack, Udemy, or Zoom.  If you have more time, you can always work ahead in the Udemy courses.  


Remember to answer the initial questionnaire, especially the scheduling question, by Monday April 27 at noon!  Once the answers are in, I'll schedule the meetings and send out invitations and Zoom info.
