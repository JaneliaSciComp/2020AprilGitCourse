-----------
- my notes from watching the videos
- https://hhmi.udemy.com/course/git-and-github-masterclass/
- warning: for entertainment purposes only!  not meant as a study aid!

Section 1: Getting Started with Git (1h)
- 1: What is Version Control 
    - emphasizes difference between git, GitHub
    - covers basics: track changes, collaborate
    - mention careful with using git for big binaries!  (he mentions doc, pdf)
- 2: Install Git on Windows 
- 3: Install Git on macOS 
- 4: Install Git on Linux 
    - all three: sends to https://git-scm.com/downloads
    - can skip the ones you don't need
    - includes git --version test
    - Mac guides through "unidentified developer" security step
- 5: Setup Git Workspace on Windows 
- 6: Setup Git Workspace on Mac/Linux 
    - configure git-bash or terminal
    - configure the command prompt using bash_profile and two shell scripts
        that heavily configure prompt and autocomplete
    - the files look legit; they are dense, and I didn't check every line, but
        they look safe and OK; the two scripts are directly from git, apparently
    - for Windows, move and rename files; for Mac/Linux, need to edit existing bash profile
- 7: Executing a First Commit 
    - using VSCode as editor; referenced IDE section later
    - this is the start of things you should follow along with
    -- (and I do) (but I didn't do the terminal config, so I don't see that stuff;
        I see it in my editor and GUI client instead)
    - note that "add" doesn't add to the repo, but to the staging area!
- 8: Understanding The Full Commiting Process
    - don't mess with .git!
    - yes, it can get big...holds whole history
    - staging area is kind of a pain; 
    -- it's where you choose which changes to commit (need not be all)
    -- see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49228209/whats-the-use-of-the-staging-area-in-git
    -- but beware changes after staging!  need to restage
    --> I personally rarely stage until I also commit
- 9: Reviewing File Changes 
    - ugh, command line diff...you don't have to!
    -- editor or GUI client or stand-alone client will help
    - note that git in general does a good job of identifying small changes 
- 10: Missing Git Configurations 
    - set up name, email, editor
    - commit messages in editor
    - git hash (SHA)
    - git diff by hash

Section 2: Getting Started with GitHub (40m)
- 11: Git and GitHub 
    - the difference!
    - (me: git = source control + synchronization tools) (your repo is yours)
    - he covers this nicely...
- 12: Create your GitHub account 
    - straightforward
    - mention orgs
    - tour
    - create first repo, same name; no README; stop there
- 13: Pushing your Local Repo to GitHub 
    - straightforward
    - GitHub of course changes UI often; I didn't see "contributors" tab
    - not sure why it said "push -u" in the GitHub suggestion?
    -- apparently sets upstream tracking branch?
    - origin and master: naming conventions
- 14: Editing Code and Commiting from GitHub 
    - basically, mostly don't do this!
    -- it's too easy!  enhances your ability to make errors
    -- no opportunity to test!
    - if you must, try to limit to very simple changes, especially
        those in (eg) text files that aren't code (ie, don't need testing)
- 15: Pulling from the Remote 
    - he does full "git pull origin master" at start; later he sets upstream
    - output will vary; mine was wordier 
    - note that the -u in GitHub's "new repo" command hint would do this
- 16: Check for Changes with Git Status 
    - GIT STATUS IS YOUR BEST FRIEND!
    -- often gives you nice hints as to the command you might want
    - hmm, my git status is not showing the proper remote status?  says up to date?
    -- Q&A has the answer: might need git fetch first
    - "working tree" = staging area
    - he kind of cheats; the changes he made locally and on GitHub don't conflict
        in any way; that situation will be covered later (merge conflicts)

Section 3: Fork and Clone (1h15m)
- 17: Intro to Forking GitHub Repositories 
    - fork is only GitHub, not git
- 18: Cloning a Repository 
    - repo proliferation begins...
    - remember, your repo is yours
    - note when cloning, he did a folder-in-folder with same name (if he hadn't misspelled it!)
    -- this is up to you; often I have a project folder with a repo inside, but also other stuff
    -- and you will probably make some mistakes and get more/fewer folders than you want!
    - clone sets the remote automatically
    - you can clone anything you like; from Janelia, something you use, or whatever
- 19: Exploring Git Logs 
    - creates a new folder for a new repo on disk; clones big project for more commits to see
    - I'm not going to clone a new one; I'll follow in the workstation project
    - talks about HEAD
    - git diff by sha
    --> GUI clients are often pretty good about automatically grabbing and
        displaying some of this info
- 20: Getting Commit and File Details with Git 
    - git show ~ git log + git diff
    - HEAD~1 etc.
    -- again, GUI often shows things in a list, making that unneeded
    - git annotate filename (like IJ annotate; kind of like git blame?)
    - IDE support preview
- 21: Exploring Commit and File Details from GitHub 
    - GitHub display of same info as previously
    - Blame button
    - browse earlier version of repo
    - History button for a file (git log filename, right?)
- 22: Making Changes 
    - when making changes, not all editors will show blame the same way
    - git commit -a (careful...you lose control this way)
    - could have ommitted "origin master" on push, I think
    - again, your repo is yours
    - preview of pull request
    -- obviously be careful here!
- 23: Undoing Changes and Reverting Commits 
    - git checkout > git restore in latest git (very new!)
    - git status hints to the rescue again!
    - the stage vs unstaged confusion again...
    - git reset is the gun you don't want to point at your foot!
    - this is a simple "replace file with older version" fix
    -- there are other rollback options 
    - git add .: not a fan; explicitly adding files is better
    -- but I understand the attraction if you're not using an IDE or GUI client
    -- not so bad with reset and checkout, though

Section 4: Working with Branches (1h15m)
- 24: Good Version Control Practices 
    - "you should always have a working version": people will argue, 
        but it's generally good advice at the start
    -- lots of advice that people argue about aren't worth arguing about
        if you're a beginner
    - yes, you should do this, even working alone
    -- details vary; separate test branch is more formal, but branches
        for dev/feature, fixes, releases are quite common
    -- there are lots of formal project layouts that one can use here
    - I don't like his diagrams because the branches look disconnected,
        when at some point, they were part of the trunk!
    -- (I guess he was saving that for the next section)
- 25: What is a Branch? 
    - he's assuming a specific layout here, but it doesn't really matter
    - I really don't like his train-track diagram at ~3m!
    - deleting branches is also kind of misleading!
    -- the commits aren't gone; it's just a pointer
    - fork is kind of a remote branch; it's not a git thing, but a GitHub thing
    - more clarification on HEAD as a pointer?
    - show a GUI branch diagram!
- 26: Creating a Branch with Git 
    - (I cloned rather than forked the html5-boilerplate repo)
    - GUI clients often immediately checkout a new branch
    - he talks about branching practice along with branching, which is good
    - note that git checkout is not just for that terminal session; it's 
        persistant (there are files written on disk)
    -- your other clients will also see it immediately
- 27: Creating a Branch with GitHub 
    - editing files in GH again, ugh
    - honestly, you're not really going to do a lot of this from GH normally
    - peek ahead at pull request
- 28: Adding a gitignore File 
    - things you shouldn't put in git: pwds, credentials, api keys, etc
    - how to clean them out if you commit and push them to GH (hard)
    - alternate plan: shouldn't be in code anyway; put in env variables
        (part of deployment) (although you often want that automated 
        and committed, too...)
    - this is not a license to be messy!  you should still carefully separate
        your code from your other random stuff rather than using .gitignore to 
        manage it for you!
    - in fact, if you're ignoring a lot of files, that's a sign that maybe
        they are in the wrong place (ie, separate builds and code, data and code, etc.)
    -- although a lot of things will not give you good choices (require certain files
        and layouts)
- 29: Syncing Branches 
    - git push origin [branchname]
    - how many commits ahead/behind master
    - git checkout --track origin/[branchname]: pulls, checks out, tracks, all at once
    --> yes, sometimes you don't want to track, or change tracking, but it's rare
    --- often when switching remote (eg, bitbucket to github)
    - how to show remotes?
- 30: Graph the Branches on the Terminal 
    - git log --graph
    - this is where graphical clients do a far better job than the terminal
    -- on GitHub, Insights > Network
    - note that the various branch labels (which are pointers to a line of commits) are
        as of the last time your client (of whatever kind) talked to the remote
- 31: Merging Branches in the Terminal 
    - his merge did a fast-forward, I think?  need to define that
    - note that git generates the message; a merge is a new commit
    - yes, deleting branches is normal procedure; you are going to use a lot of them,
        and you don't want the clutter
    -- some tools will offer to delete immediately when you make a merge; some will
        also warn if you try to delete and the contents haven't been merged
    -- need to verify (maybe demo) that commits (and commit messages) aren't lost, 
        just no longer have a branch pointer/label attached
    -- I believe you can push branch deletion, too?
    - maybe suggest watching #34 here, types of merges
- 32: Pull Requests in GitHub 
    - this is purely a GitHub thing, not git
    - but you can do the same, with more typing, without GH, between two repos
    - it's kind of weird that he's doing his own pull requests; normally you'd
        just be merging in your local repo and pushing changes 
        - normally the pull request is social conventions on top of git enabling
        merging between two different repos controlled by different people/orgs
    - note that GH is very good about suggesting pull requests when you push changes
        that don't exist on the place you branched from
    - eg, in NeuTu, I branch features and send PR to Ting for approval (more later)
    - merges have multiple parents (could be >2) (cf "octopus merge")


Section 5: Merge Conflicts (1h)
- 33: When do Merge Conflicts Happen? 
    - merge conflicts are the cost of branches
    - branches are extraordinarily useful
    - and though merge conflicts can be hairy, need to respect and not fear
    - intro to git <<<<< ===== >>>>>> markings in file
- 34: Types of Merges 
    - he's making diagrams I like now; I will probably show them before this
    - fast-forward merge (which doesn't create a new commit)
    - and he shows branch deletion as a pointer removal
    - recursive merge; he shows branch gone but commits remain
    - he doesn't mention the octopus merge...
    --> I should assign this video earlier, after 31?
- 35: A First Merge Conflict 
    - back to original repo
    - what's the resources for?  looks like the repo before changes
    - create two branches from master, edit on each one without merging
    -- the double Bootstrap add looks like an attempt to make it messier?
    - merge one branch into master: ffwd
    - the colors are in his editor; this is why GUI clients are good for merge conflicts
    - git status tells you how to abort
- 36: Solving the Conflict 
    - looking forward: GUIs will make this easier
    - as usual, git status tells you the steps
    --> depending on how carefully you followed his edits, the resolution   
        steps might vary!  I was sloppy and had more to fix; this is one
        spot where knowing some html does help
    - git add; then git status shows you what's next
    - git commit; git gives you a default merge message if you don't provide one
    - at this point, my master had not diverged from remote, but it was ahead
    -- I must not have done all the edits he did on GH?
    -- so if I push, I'm not going to get a conflict like he does
    -- you're going to have to go make an edit on GH in index.html if your
        git status doesn't show a divergence
    -- so I do an edit, then git fetch so git status shows me the divergence
    - now git push is rejected
    - git pull = git fetch + git merge
    - git push is like a ffwd merge; if conflicts, rejected
    - when you have changes to push and you pull, potential merge conflict...but
        if not, you should still test!
    -- notice in fact that he missed something in his resolution: he left in some
        duplicate lines
- 37: Merge Conflicts on GitHub 
    - remember, a pull request is a request to merge to the owner of a repo
    -- could also be two people on the same repo, as it turns out; for NeuTu,
        Ting is the lead dev, and I work on branches; I send him pull requests
        to merge my branches into master on the same repo
    - not really easy to follow along for this one; you could find another 
        person and fork each others repos and make incompatible changes, send
        pull requests if you like
    - or could do it live in class with a single volunteer?
    - the concepts are similar as a regular pull request; we're just separating
        the responsibilities for fixing conflicts
    -- I think his pretending to be two people is actually confusing
- 38: Solving Merge Conflicts on GitHub 
    - if you can merge a pull request immediately, could be either ffwd or recursive
        merge, remember
    - I like his comment on pushback; contributor really ought to fix things, mostly;
        they might need to pull changes first (always a good idea when merging!)
    - again, I find his dual personalities confusing; watch the URLs to track
        which account he's in
    --> note: you can do this outside GH, too; it takes more pushing and pulling,
        and in some cases, you have to specify different remotes than origin; but
        it can be done; when changes are extensive, you might want to use better
        tools than the GH website to do your work (ie, tests!!!)
- 39: Adding Tags to the Repository 
    - tags for versioning
    - if you didn't do the pull request stuff, you won't need to pull
    - git tag -a [tag name]
    - tag is another label, like a branch, but it doesn't move, unlike a branch
    - without the -a is what he said: it's lightweight, and doesn't record the user,
        other metadata; stick to the -a tags, probably
    - git log --pretty=oneline; there are lots of variations for git log!
    -- but again, adding tags, especially to older commits, is easy in GUIs,
        because they display log and branch info much better than the command line
    - git push --tags
    - on GH: release is a GH thing, but seems to happen at least partially 
        automatically from tags?
    -- holds doubly for the archives GH creates for a release

Section 6: Collaboration in GitHub (1h)
- 40: Colaboration on Private Repos and Cloning to Colab 
    - working 100% in GH
    - not sure what he's up to right now...
    - added his second account as collab on private repo of first account
    -- showed invite
    - collab can push, not just fork/clone
    - huh, GH can show an .ipynb file
    - Google Colab?  can edit ipynb online, without installing anything 
        (which we don't want to do for a git course)
    -- need a Google account for this
    - create folder in drive, python 3 notebook in colab
    - ugh, the UI doesn't match what I see...no sidebar arrow?
    -- it's the folder icon instead
    - instead of his package import, there is a button now for "mount drive"
    -- prompts for which Google account (should be same as your drive)
    -- the location the button chooses is the same as his
    - cd to the TextAnalytics with %cd (check with !pwd)
    -- I am not liking this version of notebooks...the UI is strange
    - (~13:30) clone in colab?
    -- but Q&A says you need to fork his repo in your account first, then clone
        from there
    -- OMG, he's embedding credentials in colab?  so he can clone the repo?
    --- without, you could clone but not push, though
    - then from drive, can right-click on notebook in cloned repo and open
        in colab
    - makes a small change; from the other untitled notebook, can
        execute more git commands
    - add email/name first, then add and commit
    - then push: and this works, because he owns it; this is where you
        would have had to fork to and then clone from your account
    - he shows how the git diff on GH shows a mess, because it's a notebook
    - note: you can clone it locally and work from there, if you already have
        some way to work on notebooks (why is he even trying this?  why
        not stick to text editable code?)
    --> I don't really understand what the payoff is here
    -- and without two accounts, you can't really expect students to follow along?
- 41: Protecting Branches on GitHub 
    - exactly which branches you protect, who is allowed to do what, is 
        part of your overall branching and release strategy
    - really don't rename master...everyone expects it
    - add rule to protect master & dev; require pull request review
    - now he's going on about this AI MS service with a free API key that
        he's exposing??
    -- but...it's still really about the changes; nothing has to function
    -- yet he talks about it...
    - (I am not doing any of this right now...)
    - he makes a change and commits to master
    - but then creates new branch
    - then pushes that branch
    -- not clear why he didn't branch first?
    - then visit GH and create PR; messages say, you need a reviewer
    - this is still confusing, the two account business
    - hmm...I could create a repo with everyone as collaborators...let them
        push and create PR to it...protect a branch, leave another open, etc.
    - note that this info is only if you have collaborator who can push directly!
- 42: Requiring Reviews in Pull Requests 
    - assign reviewer
    - also assignee, label fields
    -- you probably shouldn't change other project's labels!
    - comment on code: ask sender (with @ mention) for info; resolve conversation != review
    - reviewer can comment, approve, or request changes
    - then merge PR?  could be reviewer or the assignee (= sender, in this case)
        (since this assignee has merge permission)
    - and delete branch
    - this is still confusing with the two accounts business
- 43: Working with Issues and PRs in GitHub 
    - issues need to be enabled in the repo (isn't that default on?)
    - issue submission (again with the dual accounts) (with task list) (and assignee)
    - does edits in colab
    - new branch, then commit, adds "solves #2" in message, which links issue in commit or PR
    - push branch
    - then to GH and create PR; add reviewer, assignee, etc
    - but after approval, assignee makes another change
    - re-request review
    - but could have merged anyway?  that seems wrong...maybe just the old commit, not new?
    - merge after re-approval
    - then comment and close (ref to PR and commits in history)
    - then he did another PR from dev > master

Section 7: Working with an Open Source Project (1h10m)
- 44: Adding a README file 
    - working with the TextAnalytics repo from above, ugh
    - sets it public
    -- at Janelia, be careful!  check with your supervisor before making things public
    - he removes his second account as collab for teaching purposes
    - edits README in GH; this is more a "best practices" thing; he goes over
        what info should appear here (markdown is a later section)
    -- I think this whole section is going to be like that, more advice than tech
    - info, installation, getting started, how to contribute...etc.
    - GH topic list
    - how to follow along: don't have to do a version of his repo; could even
        just create a new, empty repo and fill in dummy info
- 45: Adding the important Templates 
    - contributing file (I have never seen this?)
    -- social stuff: thanks, code of conduct
    -- what help is requested/welcome: features, bug reports, fixes, and procedures for them
    - hmm, GH directly people to docs/CONTRIBUTING.md first time they try to open an issue?
    - settings > a place to create templates for issues etc.
    -- and there are templates for the templates...
    -- shows up in .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE folder
    -- or could have single docs/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
    - for PR, it's docs/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
    - as above, you can do this in any repo you have
    - but testing it will be difficult as usual (he does a better job with
        the two-account confusion here, I thought)
- 46: Filtering the Git Log to Better Understand the repo 
    - looking from contributor side
    - he wants us to fork his TextAnalytics repo
    - at least he clones locally
    - git log again
    - git shortlog to get authors; git log --author [name] for more info
    - git log --grep [pattern in title]
    - can mix git log filters, too
    - git log --since [time]
    --> honestly, this is just masochistic; just use a GUI of some kind
    - however, examining the repo is a good idea
    - last bit: he's back to colab and drive, ugh...
- 47: The Full Contribution Flow - Beyond Pull Requests 
    - walks through the fork and clone again in colab
    - seems better if we do this on a simpler repo I create/control?
        the whole ipynb thing doesn't add to the course at all
    - makes changes; ugh, branch sloppiness; he takes some confusing time clearing it up
    - pull request: from local/feature branch to remote/dev
    -- the formality is a good thing; creating issue then pr at same time is worthwhile
    - owner approves and merges
    - now back on contributor repo, compare to base repo
    -- then create pull request and immediately merge it (own repo, GH)
    -- can do this from git proper by manipulating remotes
    - note if you're a collaborator, this won't apply (one less level of indirection)
- 48: Importance and Naming of Feature Branches
    - always a working version?  sure, maybe?  doesn't have to be master,
        though; could be a version tag or release branch (eg, JW)
    - naming
    -- branch-1, LOL
    - referencing issues is vgood
    -- this goes for JIRA as well as GH, too; there is integration for JIRA as well
    - branch names are really part of your whole branching and release strategy
    -- eg, bug vs hotfix or whatever (or release)
- 49: Importance of Descriptive Commits 
    - 50 character limit?  debatable; hardcore commandline users should not 
        hold back progress
    - capitalize?  no period?  these are offensive in combination
    - seems to be following GH's published guidelines? 
    - but: if a project has guidelines, you should follow them

Section 8: Markdown (1h10m)
- 50: Introduction to Markdown 
    - useful in GH and elsewhere (eg, Jupyter notebooks)
    - some text editors support markdown, with previews (see video 56)
    -- it's often used in blogging software because it translates to html very easily
    - but note that there are some slightly different dialects!
    - note GH preview is actually the diff (shows adds and deletes, red/green margin bars)
- 51: Formatting Text with Markdown 
    - you can practice this in any repo, as before
    - basic formatting
    - hmm, GH makes headers into link anchors
- 52: Creating Lists with Markdown 
    - stuff
- 53: Adding Tables and Links with Markdown 
    - in reality, tables are a pain
    - huh, don't need leading and trailing | character?
    - can't really do eg multi-line table cells
- 54: Images and Videos using Markdown 
    - link from Internet or from your GH repo
    - his branching seems a little over-aggressive here
- 55: Writing Code Blocks using Markdown 
    - stuff
- 56: The Notion App 
    - kind of an advertisement, but take it as an example of similar apps you can find
    - it's a wysiwyg GUI editor for Markdown

Section 9: GitHub Pages (20m)
- 57: Intro to GitHub Pages 
    - website with GH repo backend
    - note: GH wiki is an alternative for some purposes
    - Jekyll = theming tool which uses markdown
    -- he doesn't cover creating your own html/css, which is supported
- 58: Creating the Page's Content 
    - create new repo; mine is private, GHPagesTest
    - create README.md from GH
    -- his example is a portfolio
    -- includes hand-made table of contents
    - commit
- 59: Publishing a GitHub Page 
    - Settings > GH Pages
    -- hmm, can't enable unless repo is public...or GitHub pro?
    -- make my repo public    
    - choose source (master branch for us)
    - URL https://olbris.github.io/GHPagesTest/
    -- but it fails?  no, just takes a second
    - choose Jekyll theme
    -- again takes a minute to update
    -- note it commits a _config.yml file
    - he navigates to a gallery of GH Pages examples

Section 10: Using Git and GitHub from the IDE (2h)
- 60: Intro to Git in Different IDEs 
    - intro; but he still pushes the terminal, which is fair
    - but I argue about the "save couple of seconds"; the information
        display, especially, is quite useful and much easier than the command line
- 61: Git and GitHub in Android Studio 
- 62: Git and GitHub in Xcode 
- 63: Git and GitHub in Visual Studio Code 
- 64: Git and GitHub in Visual Studio 
- 65: Git and GitHub in VS for Mac 
- 66: Git and GitHub in IntelliJ 
    - he's using an Android/kotlin project as example
    - I wonder how well this will age...IJ is aggressive in changing things;
        I think they changed something in VCS recently, didn't they?
    - but overall looks fine...covers most basics, but not all (eg, no pull)
    -- only saw one point where he (maybe) made a UI blunder
- 67: Git and GitHub in Eclipse 

Section 11: Intro to Continuous Integration and Delivery (45m)
    - entirely optional; I didn't do this section
    - I do know that Circle CI, for example, is a standard, widely-used tool
- 68: What is Continuous Integration 
    - mentions devops
    - talks about software development in general
    - product manager, product discovery
    - quality and speed of delivery
    - GH as hub for CI
    - automated unit tests; code coverage
- 69: What is Continuous Delivery 
    - again the software engineering overview
    - mentions big website deploying features zillions of times per day
- 70: Using Circle CI from GitHub 
    - circle CI from marketplace; free plan
    - mentions travis CI
    - setup a config yaml file and push to GH
    - circle CI gates merge to master (with protected branch)
    - didn't totally follow some of the later stuff
- 71: Using App Center from GitHub 
    - MS app center; again, free plan
    - mobile app deployment (he's a xamarin dev)
    - lots of setup and config

Section 12: Extra Information - Source code, and other stuff
- 72: Source Codes
    - just links to some source code he uses in the class
    - maybe for people who didn't follow along?
- 73: Bonus Lecture and Information
    - the guy who owns the umbrella course
    - resources = free PDS with links to free videos and ebooks
    - also references to his other paid courses, I think
