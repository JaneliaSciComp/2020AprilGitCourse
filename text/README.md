# Source Control Using Git and GitHub

This repository supports the "Source Control Using Git and GitHub" being taught at HHMI's Janelia Research Campus beginning in April 2020.

# General info

- **Who**: Anyone at Janelia writing any kind of code. The course assumes basic proficiency with computers, but it doesn't assume any knowledge of git or GitHub. The course will cover basic and intermediate git topics, so it'll be good for filling in gaps in your knowledge if you learned git in the wild. The SciComp parts of the course can be tailored to whatever the attendees want or need, including more advanced topics.
- **When**: Signups close April 24 at noon; the course begins the week of April 27.
- **What**: The core of the course will be the "Git & GitHub Masterclass" on Udemy, with supplementary lectures, labs, and Q&A sessions conducted by Don Olbris and others from Janelia SciComp. Since we're using Udemy for the core on-demand lectures, the rest of the course content and pace will be very flexible. We'll dynamically adjust the pace and content according to participant feedback.
- **How to sign up**: Email Don Olbris. You're going to want to enroll in the course on Udemy (via hhmi.udemy.com and your HHMI username).
- **How long**: Nominally the Udemy course is 11.5 hours, but some of that is optional. I estimate ~7-8 hours of Udemy videos are core. You should expect to spend another bunch of hours following along (typing commands on your computer, figuring out how/why things went wrong). We will supplement with another 5-ish sessions of lectures, Q&A, labs/demos, things like that. The Udemy part will be on-demand and self-paced. The SciComp part will be held via Zoom (interactive) and Slack (asynchronous).
- **How fast**: The course should run about 4 weeks. That would be ~2 hours of Udemy videos per week, ~1 hour of work on your computer, and 1-2 Zoom sessions, for a total of about 4-5 hours per week. The pace will be adjusted based on feedback from participants.
